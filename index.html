          <p1>"Aleksander's early interest in astronomy was inspired by his father who told him stories and myths connected with stellar constellations. As a seven-year-old he already learned the basics of astronomy. He observed the night sky using a small telescope he constructed himself." - Wiki</p1>

                <li> 1973 - Moved to Bonn, Germany for training at the Max Planck Institute for Radio Astronomy</li><br>
                <li> 1979 / 1982 - Worked at the Astronomical Center of the Polish Academy of Sciences in Toruń, Poland</li><br>
                <li> 1982 -  Moved to the United States to work at Cornell University and Princeton</li><br>
                <li> 1990 - Working with Dale Frail, Wolszczan carried out astronomical observations from the <a href="https://media.wired.com/photos/60a2cdb7c4c56a005b6967c7/master/w_2560,c_limit/Arecibo-535007406.jpg" target="blank" alt="Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico"> Arecibo Observatory</a> in Puerto Rico that led them to the discovery of the pulsar PSR B1257+12 </li><br>
                <li> 1992 - Aleksander and colleague show puslar B1257+12 was orbited by two planets, whose masses were initially assessed at 3.4 and 2.8 times Earth's mass, with the radii of their orbits being 0.36 and 0.47 AU respectively. The first confirmed discovery of planets outside our home solar system. </li><br>
                <li> 1994 - Aleksander publishes the results of his discovery and was chosen by the journal Nature as the author of one of 15 fundamental discoveries in the field of physics</li><br>
                <li> 1997 -  Polish President Aleksander Kwaśniewski presented him with the Commander's Cross of the Order of Polonia Restituta for outstanding contributions to Polish science</li><br>
                <li>1998 - Astronomy magazine included his discovery among The 25 Greatest Astronomical Findings of All Time.</li><br>
                <li>2003 - Aleksander and Maciej Konacki reevaluate the orbital inclinations of the two planets around pulsar B1257+12, showing that the actual masses were approximately 3.9 and 4.3 Earth masses respectively </li><br>
                <li>2007 - Wolszczan, while being a part of a Polish team of astronomers led by Andrzej Niedzielski, discover yet another planet outside the Solar System, HD 17092 b, orbiting star HD 17092.</li><br>
                <li> 2012 - Matthew Route and Wolszczan detect bursts of radio waves emitted from 2MASS J10475385+2124234( a brown-dwarf of spectral class, 34 light years away) using Arecibo Observatory. </li><br>
                <li> 2013 - (Webpage author self-insert) - While teaching Astro001 as a professor at Penn State University Park, Aleksander gains a student in his class who's utterly oblivious to the achievements in astronomy that he has accomplished. Same oblivious student later realizes, or more so partially fathoms, the feats that his professor has accomplished. Being a sort-of outer space geek that the student is, said student later asked for a <a href="https://imgur.com/qNHwzWV" target="blank" alt= Aleksander Wolszczan and Richard Barnett>picture</a> with his professor.</li>
